"This free online book was made possible by the generous support of Microsoft"
" Research, who paid for it to be written and given away. During the process "
"of writing, they made the expertise of the Lean development team available "
"to both answer my questions and make Lean easier to use. In particular, "
"Leonardo de Moura initiated the project and helped me get started, Chris "
"Lovett set up the CI and deployment automation and provided great feedback "
"as a test reader, Gabriel Ebner provided technical reviews, Sarah Smith kept"
" the administrative side working well, and Vanessa Rodriguez helped me "
"diagnose a tricky interaction between the source-code highlighting library "
"and certain versions of Safari on iOS."

"project, both technical and emotional. In particular, Sebastian Ullrich "
"provided key help when I was learning Lean's metaprogramming system in order"
" to write the supporting code that allowed the text of error messages to be "
"both checked in CI and easily included in the book itself. Within hours of "
"posting a new revision, excited readers would be finding mistakes, providing"
" suggestions, and showering me with kindness. In particular, I'd like to "
"thank Arien Malec, Asta Halkjær From, Bulhwi Cha, Craig Stuntz, Daniel "
