Outline:

 * Recursive functions over `Nat`, with pattern matching
   - plus, times
   - Division by iterated subtraction --- stop and say oops, return later in book
 * Simple polymorphic types a la ML, relate `Point` to `Prod`/`MProd`
 * Recursive functions over `List`, with pattern matching
 * User-defined datatypes (in the ML-typable fragment)
 * `Unit`, `Option`, `Sum`
