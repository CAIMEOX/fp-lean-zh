# The Monad Type Class

Rather than having to import an operator like `ok` or `andThen` for each type that is a monad, the Lean standard library contains type classes that allow them to be overloaded, so that the same operators can be used for _any_ monad.
Monads have two operations, which are the equivalent of `ok` and `andThen`:
```lean
{{#example_decl Examples/Monads/Class.lean FakeMonad}}
```
This definition is slightly simplified.
The actual definition in the Lean library is somewhat more involved, and will be presented later.

As an example, `firstThirdFifthSeventh` was defined separately for `Option Î±` and `Err String Î±` return types.
Now, it can be defined polymorphically for _any_ monad.
It does, however, require a lookup function as an argument, because different monads might fail to find a result in different ways.
The infix version of `bind` is `>>=`, which plays the same role as `~~>` in the examples.
```lean
{{#example_decl Examples/Monads/Class.lean firstThirdFifthSeventhMonad}}
```

Given example lists of slow mammals and fast birds, this implementation of `firstThirdFifthSeventh` can be used with `Option`:
```lean
{{#example_decl Examples/Monads/Class.lean animals}}

{{#example_in Examples/Monads/Class.lean noneSlow}}
```
```output info
{{#example_out Examples/Monads/Class.lean noneSlow}}
```
```lean
{{#example_in Examples/Monads/Class.lean someFast}}
```
```output info
{{#example_out Examples/Monads/Class.lean someFast}}
```

After renaming `Except`'s lookup function `get` to something more readable, the very same  implementation of `firstThirdFifthSeventh` can be used with `Except` as well:
```lean
{{#example_decl Examples/Monads/Class.lean getOrExcept}}

{{#example_in Examples/Monads/Class.lean errorSlow}}
```
```output info
{{#example_out Examples/Monads/Class.lean errorSlow}}
```
```lean
{{#example_in Examples/Monads/Class.lean okFast}}
```
```output info
{{#example_out Examples/Monads/Class.lean okFast}}
```
The fact that `m` must have a `Monad` instance means that the `>>=` and `pure` operations are available.

## General Monad Operations

Because many different type constructors are monads, functions that are polymorphic over _any_ monad are very powerful.
For example, the function `mapM` is a version of `map` that uses a `Monad` to sequence and combine the results of applying a function.


## The Monad Contract
Just as every pair of instances of `BEq` and `Hashable` should ensure that any two equal values have the same hash, there is a contract that each instance of `Monad` should obey.
First, `pure` should be a left identity of `bind`.
That is, `bind (pure v) f` should be the same as `f v`.
Secondly, `pure` should be a right identity of `bind`, so `bind v pure` is the same as `v`.
Finally, `bind` should be associative, so `bind (bind v f) g` is the same as `bind v (fun x => bind (f x) g)`.
