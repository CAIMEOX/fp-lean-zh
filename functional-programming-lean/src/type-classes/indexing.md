# Indexing

The [Interlude](../props-proofs-indexing.md) describes how to use indexing notation in order to look up entries in a list by their position.
This syntax is also governed by a type class, and it can be used for a variety of different types.

For instance, Lean arrays are much more efficient that linked lists for most purposes.
